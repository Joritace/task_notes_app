##  Description
This Flutter application is a simple task management app that allows users to create, view, update, and delete their daily tasks. 
The app uses a local SQLite database to store tasks permanently, ensuring that the data remains even after the app is closed.
Each task includes a title, description, and priority level, and the app displays them using a dynamic list that updates automatically whenever changes are made.
Shared Preferences is used to store small state values, while navigation between screens is handled using Flutter’s Navigator system. 
Overall, the app provides an easy-to-use interface for managing personal tasks in an organized and efficient way.
